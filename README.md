Lydia is a tool for LDLf translation to DFA and for LDLf synthesis.

## Preliminaries

Clone the repository (with submodules):
```
git clone https://github.com/whitemech/lydia.git --recursive
```

### CMake
We use CMake as a build tool. Please 
check the [official website](https://cmake.org/)
to download it for your platform.

### Flex and Bison
The project uses Flex and Bison for parsing purposes.

Firse check that you have them: ```whereis flex bison```

If no item occurs, then you have to install them:  
```sudo apt-get install -f flex bison```


### CUDD

The project depends on the CUDD library.

Firse check that you have it:
```whereis libcudd```

If no item occurs, then you have to install it.
Follow the instructions:

- enter `third_party/cudd`:
```
cd third_party/cudd
``` 
- Install CUDD:
```
./configure --enable-silent-rules --enable-obj --enable-dddmp --prefix=[install location]
sudo make install
```
  If you get an error about aclocal, this might be due to either
  1. Not having automake: 
```sudo apt-get install automake```
  2. Needing to reconfigure, do this before configuring: 
```autoreconf -i```
  3. Using a version of aclocal other than 1.14:
     modify the version 1.14 in configure accordingly.

## Graphviz

This tool uses Graphviz to display automata.
Please follow the install instructions on the official website:
<https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/>.

On Ubuntu, this should work:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libgraphviz-dev
```

## Build

To build from source, clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/whitemech/lydia.git --recursive
cd lydia
```

To build:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```
Afterwards, to run the tests:
```
make test
```

To configure the build for development, 
use the flag `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`

## Scripts

In `scripts/` you can find useful scripts for development. In particular:

- `scripts/apply-clang-format.sh` applies the fixes provided by
  `clang-format`.
- `scripts/apply-clang-tidy.sh` applies the fixes provided by
  `clang-tidy`.
  
The same scripts but with the `check` prefix lets you check whether
fixes are needed or not.

For building:
- `build.sh`: for normal build
- `build-dev.sh` for development build

For benchmarking, use `./scripts/benchmark.sh` 
(after `./scripts/build.sh`). 

## Docker development image

We provide a Docker image for development.

- Build: `./scripts/docker-build.sh`

- Run: `./scripts/docker-run.sh`

## Notes for macOS users

Although we run and test Lydia on a Linux machine, you can build and run
 Lydia on macOS systems. However, you may need to apply the following.

Install dependencies via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (e.g. `brew install flex`,
etc.). Then, in order to get the Lydia parser working, you may have to set the 
following environment variables up (e.g. in your `.bashrc`) as follows:

```
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/flex/bin:/usr/local/opt/bison/bin:$PATH"
export CXX="/usr/bin/clang++"
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH="/System/Volumes/Data/usr/local/Cellar/flex/2.6.4_1/include/:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH"
```
